What is Image Processing?

Image processing is the manipulation of visual data either to achieve an aesthetic quality or to derive data from
it, and support another task. However, when it comes to the application of this technology, the image
processing helps to bridge the gap between how we see things and how devices digitally view things. It is quite
obvious that our visual system does not see the world the way a computer or scanner does. Image processing
helps to merge the two and remove some of the stark differences between them, so that devices move, interact,
and see the way we do,

Why is image processing important?

Within the scientific community and manufacturing industry, image processing is at the helm of the technical
revolution that is being called Industry 4.0. Along with the intemet, Industry 4.0 will help in bringing together
real-time production and virtual data representation, making the process more fluid and flexible than ever
before. Therefore, the future of image processing will lay the framework for new technologies and business
models. Assembly lines these days are being automated at a faster rate than ever before, in a bid to stay
relevant and competitive. Also, industries are now very careful with regards to energy consumption, recycling,
and scrap management, as they want to minimize resource wastage. In such a setting, it is only natural that
technologies such as image processing and NLP help with automation and quality control.
