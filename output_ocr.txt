Preprocessing of images using OpenCV
We will write basic functions for different preprocessing methods

+ grayscaling
+ thresholding

+ dilating

+ eroding

+ opening

+ canny edge detection
+ noise removal

+ deskwing

+ template matching

Different methods can come in handy with different kinds of images.
